# Grid Color Restoration - Problem Package

This problem tests understanding of:
- Temporal constraint propagation
- Modular arithmetic
- Graph consistency checking
- Efficient constraint solving

The problem has a simple statement but requires careful analysis to identify the key insights. The main challenge is recognizing that the problem reduces to checking parity constraints and working backwards from given information.

**Difficulty**: Div1 C / Div2 E level
